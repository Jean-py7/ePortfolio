# Feature Branch Workflow (Research Notes)

## Branches
- `feature/*` → PR into `dev`
- `dev` → tracking PR into `stage` for the milestone
- `stage` → PR into `main` (instructor approval required)

## PR Steps
1. Create feature branch from `dev`.
2. Push and open PR to `dev` using the template.
3. Merge to `dev` when ready.
4. Keep a single tracking PR from `dev` to `stage` for the milestone.
5. Final check on `stage`, then instructor approval for `main`.
